# Guideline of Internationization Support
The project has integrated with string bundles, the localization files will not stored in local. We only store the default locale strings for development usage.

## Localization Structure
Currently, the default locale strings come from:
- Global translations
  They're stored in the file `./src/i18n/strings/en.json`.

## CI Build Phase
When triggering the CI build job, it wil run the `i18n.sh` to fetch the string bundles. The local default translation files will not be used.

## Development Phase
During the daily development, we have two choices,

### Using local default locale strings
Run command `yarn start:default`

### Using latest strings bundles
Run command `yarn start:dependency`
